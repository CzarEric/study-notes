# Lesson 1: A Social Network Magic Trick

* Introduction
    * Will learn: Algorithms that are useful for analysing large social networks
* Magic Trick
    * Collection of actors ("nodes")
    * Connected ("via edges") if they are in a movie together
    * All paths end up at Kevin Bacon in quiz if edges are only traversed once.
        * This became very interesting me after completing the course
    * First course focus:
        * Social networks
            * Connections between individuals that capture info about them
    * 2nd course focus:
        * "magic of algorithms"
            * computation that solves problems
    * Degree of node
        * Number of edges == degree of node
            * 4th degree node = 4 edges
