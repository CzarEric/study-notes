# Lesson 9: Hypothesis Testing

* Levels of likelihood
    * Probabilities statisticians have determined to be "likely" or "unlikely"
    * Alpha levels (very unlikely):
        * .05 (5%) (z-score = 1.64)
        * .01 (1%) (z-score = 2.33)
        * .001 (0.1%) (z-score = 3.1)
* Critical Regions
    * If probability is less than alpha level, will fall in the critical region in distribution:

    * If we got a sample mean at 1.95, you might say "mean is significant at p < .05"
    * Above 2.33? "significant at p < .01"
* Two-tail critical values
    * When you need to consider both ends of the distribution
    * .05% needs to be divided in half: 2.5% * 2
