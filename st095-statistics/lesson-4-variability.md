# Lesson 4: Variability

* Quanify spread == work out "spreadoutness" of distribution
* Outliers increase the variability of data
* Dealing with outliers:
    * Cut off tail of data - lower 25% and upper 25%

        * Called the 'Interquartile Range' or IQR
* IQR
    * 50% of data falls within IQR
    * It's not affected by every value in dataset like outliers
* Outlier formula:
    * ```outlier < (q1 - 1.5 * iqr)```
    * ```outlier > (q3 + 1.5 * iqr)```
* Boxplots (aka box-and-whisper plots)
