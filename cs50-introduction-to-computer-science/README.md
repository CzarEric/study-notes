# CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (2011)

## Status

Abandoned - around 2011

## Notes

Notes from CS50 taken via Harvard Open Learning in around 2011. The assignments I did complete were completed in Python and the notes are rough and inconsistent. Adding to the repo for completion sake more than anything.

I really did enjoyed this course and would highly recommend it. Especially since it's now available via Edx.
